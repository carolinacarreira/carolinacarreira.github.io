I am a Ph.D. Student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh (by Prof. Nicolas Christin) and Instituto Superior Técnico at the University of Lisbon (by Prof. João F. Ferreira and Prof. Alexandra Mendes). 

My current research interests are **usable security**, **software engineering**. My focus is asymmetric communication in contexts of security and privacy. I'm interested in understanding how experts, end-users, and companies communicate about privacy and how we can improve this communication. 

I also love volunteering, and I'm currently part of ACM SIGPLAN-M as a matching coordinator and I'm on the Student Committee at INESC-ID. I'm currently also collaborating with the [Adamastor Project](https://projectoadamastor.org/) that aims to bring free public domain ebooks to more people. I played the violin and was part of my university musical group -- [TMIST](https://tmist.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). My hobbies include crafting and reading unpublished books.


Feel free to contact me using my socials to discuss any of these topics.

  title={On Usable Security and Verified Password Managers}, 
  author={Carreira, Carolina}, 
  abstract={Password Managers (PMs) are useful tools to manage passwords but they are not widely used. Studies indicate usability problems and distrust from users as the reasons for the low adoption of PMs.
    As such, we propose extending an existing PM by implementing relevant usability best practices and increasing transparency by educating users about how PMs work.
    This project is part of the PassCert research project, which aims to build a formally verified PM. Therefore, another goal is to explore ways that effectively convey to users the formally verified properties.
    We performed user studies that suggest that our solution improves the usability of the PM and that we were able to convey relevant information about its formally verified features. We contribute with the first study on users' perceptions of formal verification on PMs and hope that our findings can help the formal verification security community  better communicate with end-users. },

   abstract={Machine Learning is widely used by practitioners to solve complex challenges However despite being trusted by 76 of the public scientists struggle to explain the rationale behind machine learningbased decisions This is concerning because research has shown that people often rely on inaccurate machine learning recommendations even when the system is not confident or they have prior knowledge To address these issues there is a crucial need for greater transparency and education around machine learning decision making In this work we propose a set of guidelines and design implications to communicate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence models to the general audience We do this through a literature review of the latest and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods and validate these insights through a user study encompassing the participants interpretations of the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence solutions Combining the insights from this mixedmethod study we identify seven main communication guidelines for improving machine learning models understanding This study contributes to the broader discussion of ethical implications surrounding opaque machine learning models in decisionmaking Through the development of guidelines we hope to bridge the gap between machine learning experts and the public enabling a better common understanding of its increasing importance in our lives},

  author={Lima, Rui and Ferreira, Joao F and Mendes, Alexandra and Carreira, Carolina},
  journal={Automated Software Engineering},
  year={2024},   
  abstract={Vulnerability detection and repair is a demanding and expensive part of the software development process As such there has been an effort to develop new and better ways to automatically detect and repair vulnerabilities DifFuzz is a stateoftheart tool for automatic detection of timing sidechannel vulnerabilities a type of vulnerability that is particularly difficult to detect and correct Despite recent progress made with tools such as DifFuzz work on tools capable of automatically repairing timing sidechannel vulnerabilities is scarce In this paper we propose DifFuzzAR a tool for automatic repair of timing sidechannel vulnerabilities in Java code The tool works in conjunction with DifFuzz and it is able to repair 56 of the vulnerabilities identified in DifFuzzs dataset The results show that the tool can automatically correct timing sidechannel vulnerabilities being more effective with those that are controlflow based In addition the results of a user study show that users generally trust the refactorings produced by DifFuzzAR and that they see value in such a tool in particular for more critical code}

  title={Exploring Usable Security to Improve the Impact of Formal Verification: A Research Agenda},
  author={Carreira, Carolina and Ferreira, Jo{\~a}o F and Mendes, Alexandra and Christin, Nicolas},
  journal={First Workshop on Applicable Formal Methods (co-located with Formal Methods 2021).},
  year={2021},
  abstract={As software becomes more complex and assumes an even greater role in our lives, formal verification is set to become the gold standard in securing software systems into the future, since it can guarantee the absence of errors and entire classes of attack. Recent advances in formal verification are being used to secure everything from unmanned drones to the internet. At the same time, the usable security research community has made huge progress in improving the usability of security products and end-users comprehension of security issues. However, there have been no human-centered studies focused on the impact of formal verification on the use and adoption of formally verified software products. We propose a research agenda to fill this gap and to contribute with the first collection of studies on people's mental models on formal verification and associated security and privacy guarantees and threats. The proposed research has the potential to increase the adoption of more secure products and it can be directly used by the security and formal methods communities to create more effective and secure software tools.},

  title={Towards Improving the Usability of Password Managers},
  author={Carreira, Carolina and Ferreira, Jo{\~a}o F and Mendes, Alexandra},
  journal={INFORUM},
  year={2021},
  abstract={Security experts strongly recommend the use of Password
    Managers (PMs). However, PMs are not widely used and studies indi-
    cate usability problems and distrust from users as the reasons for their
    low adoption. In this paper, we review usability challenges of PMs and
    we propose the use of known usability best practices and techniques to
    extend and improve Bitwarden, a widely-popular open-source PM. Since
    this work is done in the context of the PassCert project, which aims
    to build a formally verified PM, we also investigate ways to effectively
    convey to users the formally verified properties. We report on prelim-
    inary results and we propose a methodology to evaluate our extension
    of Bitwarden and to determine the impact of formal verification on the
    adoption of PMs.},
